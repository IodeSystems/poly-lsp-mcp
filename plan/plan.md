# poly-lsp-mcp — roadmap

> How this plan works: this file = current state + active work + decisions

Fused multi-language LSP + MCP server, one binary. The LSP side multiplexes
child LSPs (gopls/tsserver/pylsp) over a tree-sitter symbol index that crosses
languages (lexical / declared / schema-anchored tiers). `poly-lsp-mcp mcp --root
<dir>` boots the MCP surface on the same index.

## Current state

- Phases 0–6.1 (scaffold, multiplex, cross-language index + rename,
  stacked-branch parse cache, MCP server, diagnostics-in-edit-responses,
  tool ergonomics) — ✅ all in `done.md`.
- MCP default surface: **3 tools** — node_query / node_read / node_edit —
  over one unified node tree (project > dir > file > symbols > argument),
  addressed as `<file>#<sym>`, queried by CSS selector. Legacy 9-tool surface
  behind `--legacy-tools`. Sandbox jail + read-only mode: commit `0fbeb02`.
- Selector language: CSS containment + the graph as NODES. References are
  reified edge pseudo-elements — `::in`/`::out`, kind as class
  (.call/.type/.import), far end as child, site as address (file@line),
  invisible to `*` (gates are opaque). `{m,n}` = regex repetition on
  elements/(groups); edge hops on an edge element. `:parents(sel)` = the one
  inverse (upstream roots). Bare `:any/:all/:empty` = position claims.
  Language classes (file.go/func.ts), `:first`/`:last` per anchor. Shipped
  2026-07-17 in three slices → done.md ("Graph selector language") for the
  full design record; slice 3 ("references are NODES") is the shipped
  language.

## Active work

None in flight. The graph selector language (three slices) ✅ → done.md.
Next candidates are opt-in, in icebox.md — most valuable: adoption
measurement (does bonsai USE ::in/::out unprompted?), then the child-LSP
edge-precision pass (refConf lexical → lsp).

Known caveats (documented in code): edges are name-keyed via the lexical
index, so same-named symbols share edges (the LSP pass is the fix);
unbounded `{m,}` collects nodes at their shortest hop; `:where(sel)` ≡
`:any(sel)` at tip granularity (pseudoHolds).

## Non-goals (for now)

- Indexing the entire host filesystem; we only index inside the git root.
- Replacing any single child LSP. We multiplex, we don't reimplement.
- Sandboxing child LSPs. They run as the user.
- Windows support until someone asks.
